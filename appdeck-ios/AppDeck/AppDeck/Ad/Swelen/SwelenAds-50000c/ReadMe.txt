DESCRIPTION:

The Swelen iOS SDK provides a static library to enable developers to
place ads into their own applications. This SDK can display image ads with a
fixed dimension, overlay ads, video ads and advanced ads.

The Swelen library comprises one header file (swAdAPI.h) and a static
library (libswAdLib.a). 

When a user clicks on the ad, the advertiser's website is launched in a
full-screen UIWebView.

In order to show ads, you need to have signed up with Swelen from which you
can define applications and slots. Test slots UIDs are provided.
When you have completed testing, contact us with the following:

1) a screenshot of the ad impression in your application
2) a screenshot of the advertiser's website after clicking on the ad

After we finish reviewing and approving your supplied materials, you can then
replace the test slots by your slot UIDs.
